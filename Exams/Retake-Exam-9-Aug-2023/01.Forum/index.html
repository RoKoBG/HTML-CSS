                    Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions.
                    Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a
                    feeling that you can become great too.

            Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of
            self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best
            of which you are capable.

        Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The
        ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational
        objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon
        results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a
        team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work. John Doe
